# Priyanshu's Portfolio

This repository contains two portfolio implementations:

## 1. Next.js Portfolio (Recommended)

The **main-portfolio** directory contains a Next.js implementation that is optimized for Vercel deployment.

**ðŸ‘‰ For the best experience, use the [main-portfolio](./main-portfolio) directory.**

```bash
cd main-portfolio
```

See the [main-portfolio README](./main-portfolio/README.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

## 2. React Vite Portfolio (Alternative)

The **frontend-portfolio** directory contains an alternative implementation built with React and Vite.

```bash
cd frontend-portfolio
```

## Vercel Deployment

The recommended approach is to deploy the Next.js portfolio (main-portfolio) to Vercel:

1. Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/import)
2. Connect to your GitHub repository
3. Select the `main-portfolio` directory as the root
4. Deploy!
